* Objective
  - To simulate the Optimal For Aging experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-ii-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Optimal For Aging/Optimal For Aging_01_Usability_smk.org][Optimal For Aging_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Using the scrollbar select the  values for variables like Handling of worm,Abundance of worm,Fractions,Ending value,Handling of Beetle and Abundance of Beetle
  6. Click on the Run button to start the simulation process
  7. To restart the simulation process, click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. Result Graphs should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the reset button, the graphs displayed on the screen should be erased and It should redirect to the simulation home  page

* Review/comments
