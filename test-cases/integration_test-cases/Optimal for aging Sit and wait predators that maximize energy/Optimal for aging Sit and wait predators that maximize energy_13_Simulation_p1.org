* Objective
  - To simulate the Optimal for aging Sit and wait predators that maximize energy experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-ii-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Optimal for aging Sit and wait predators that maximize energy/Optimal for aging Sit and wait predators that maximize energy_01_Usability_smk.org][Optimal for aging Sit and wait predators that maximize energy_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Select the Average time and Using the scrollbar select the  values for variables like Abundance of prey, Velocity, Start Value,Fraction and End Value 
  6. Click on the Plot Graph button to start the simulation process
  7. To restart the simulation process, click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. After selecting the variable values and when we click on the Plot Graph button,then the  result Graphs should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the reset button, the graphs displayed on the screen should be erased and It should redirect to the simulation home  page

* Review/comments
