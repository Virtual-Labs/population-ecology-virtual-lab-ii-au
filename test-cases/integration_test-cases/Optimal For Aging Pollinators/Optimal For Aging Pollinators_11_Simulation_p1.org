* Objective
  - To simulate the Optimal For Aging Pollinators experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-ii-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Optimal For Aging Pollinators/Optimal For Aging Pollinators_01_Usability_smk.org][Optimal For Aging Pollinators_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Don't select the  values for variables like Posotion of flowers,Necter Delay(p),eb,tb and 
  6. click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. Nothing should be displayed in the simulation page and When we click on the reset button, the graphs displayed on the screen should be erased and It should redirect to the simulation home  page

* Review/comments
