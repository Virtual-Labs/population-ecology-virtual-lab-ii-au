* Objective
  - To simulate the Optimal For Aging Pollinators experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/population-ecology-virtual-lab-ii-au/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Optimal For Aging Pollinators/Optimal For Aging Pollinators_01_Usability_smk.org][Optimal For Aging Pollinators_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Using the scrollbar select the  values for variables like Posotion of flowers,Necter Delay(p),eb,tb.
  6. Click on more variables button and assign the values for variables like ew,tw,ef,tfee,te and position and then click on the close button
  7. Click on the Plot Total Energy button and then click on the Plot Net Calorie button.
  8. To restart the simulation process, click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. A simulator link should be present
  3. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk charactersthe 
  4. When we click on the Plot Net Calorie and Plot Total Energy button  result Graphs should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the reset button, the graphs displayed on the screen should be erased and It should redirect to the simulation home  page
